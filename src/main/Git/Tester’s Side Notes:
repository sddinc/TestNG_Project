    ● In my project, the test lead was review code.
    But if there is no team lead/test lead then
    we do peer review. Everyone's code must go through review.
    But, the test lead can decide/choose the flow.
    Every commit must be reviewed.
    ● I would commit my changes, whenever
    I completed automation of some user story.
    Then I would add a commit message like:
    "completed automation of VYT-4321 Driver should be able to add fuel logs".
    It's not only about scripts, you can also add utilities,
    fix something... The main idea is that we have to be careful with the master branch.
    ● Protect master branch from direct commits and enforce pull requests with code review.
     Code review will improve code quality.
      Also, we will make sure that the master branch has 100% working code.

  DataProvider means
  that the same test methods
  can be run multiple
  times with different datasets.

  ● By using @DataProvider annotation,
    I can create a Data Driven Framework

  ● Annotated methods return an array of Object, i.e.
  Object[][] two dimensional array.
  ● DataProvider can have a name, and
  it will be used in other methods by using its name.
  ● It can be implemented
  in the same class or different classes.

   @Test(dataProvider = "testDate")
      public void titleVerification2(String url, String title) {
          Driver.getDriver().get(url);
          org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Driver.getDriver().getTitle(), title);
      }

      @DataProvider
      public Object[][] testDate() {
          return new Object[][]{{"https://www.amazon.com/", "Amazon.com: Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more"},
                  {"https://www.google.com/", "Google"}};
      }

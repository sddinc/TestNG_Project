    ● We can use “parallel” attribute in testng.xml
    to accomplish parallel test execution in TestNG

    ● The parallel attribute of suite
    tag can accept four values:
    ○ Classes: All the test cases inside a java class will run parallel
    ○ Methods: All the methods with @Test annotation will execute parallel
    ○ Instances: Test cases in the same instance will execute parallel but two methods of
    two different instances will run in different threads.

    <suite name=”softwaretestingmaterial”
    parallel=”methods”>
    Parallel execution in testNG

    ● In xml file write:
    parallel=”tests”thread-count=”4”
    Thread-count is how many browsers you want to open same time

    ● In the xml file you can add .* to run everything.
    Ex: <package name=”.*”></package>

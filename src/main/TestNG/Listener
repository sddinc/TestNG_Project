   TestNG listeners mainly
   used to generate the
   report for the test.
   Also, you can capture
   a screenshot when there is a test failure.

   Using ITestListener interface
   and method onTestFailure
    we can get a screenshot of our failed test case.



   ● configure reports and logging.
   ● widely used listeners : ITestListener interface.
   ● It has methods like onTestStart, onTestSucess. onTestFailure, on TestSkipped...
   ● we should implement this interface creating a listener class of our own,
   ● Next, we should add the listeners annotation (@Listeners) in the class

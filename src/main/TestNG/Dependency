    We can do TestNG’s dependency
    feature using “dependsOnMethods”

     ● DependsOnMethods = “test method name” You Can add multiple test names
         ● If the first one fails, the 2nd test won't run at all
         ● If the first method failed, your report will show that the 2nd test will be skipped
         @Test(dependsOnMethods={“WebLogIn”})

    @Test
    public void stepOne() {
     System.out.println("Executing stepOne");
      }

    @Test(dependsOnMethods = { "stepOne" })
    public void stepTwo() {
    System.out.println("Executing stepOne->stepTwo");
    }

    @Test(dependsOnMethods = { "stepOne", "stepTwo" })
    public void stepThree() {
    System.out.println("Executing stepOne->stepTwo->stepThree");
    }

Hard Assertion:
Hard assert throws an AssertException
immediately when an assert statement fails,
and test suite continues with next @Test.
If Assert steps fails, execution of test stops at that point! and will go to next test if present!
(Example: just simple Assert.assertTrue(boolean);)

Soft Assertion:
Soft assert collects errors during @Test.
Soft Assert does not throw an exception
when an assert fails and would continue
with the next step after the assert statement.
If Verify steps fails, it will report a fail but will continue execution!

    JUnit: @Test, @BeforeClass, @AfterClass, @Before, @After, @Ignore


    TestNG: @Test, @BeforeTest, @BeforeClass, @BeforeSuite,
    @BeforeMethod, @AfterTest, @AfterClass, @AfterSuite,
    @AfterMethod

    Both are testing frameworks
    to help us to run automation scripts.

    TestNG provide html report

    Test prioritization,
    Parallel testing is possible in TestNG.
    It is not supported by JUnit.

    TestNG has @Dataprovider
    annotation same
    as Cucumber Scenario
    Outline for Data Driven Testing.

    In TestNG, we can
    do parallel testing,
    but JUnit doesn't
    support parallel testing,
    so we use SeleniumGrid for it.

    TestNG support
    group test but
    JUnit doesn't support

    TestNG and JUnit
    both of them have
    parameterized testing
    but TestNG parameterized
    test configuration is very easy to configure.
    There are two ways to achieve parameterization in TestNG;
     @Parameters and TestNG xml file
     @DataProvider

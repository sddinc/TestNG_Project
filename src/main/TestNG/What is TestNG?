    TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit but
    introducing new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use.

    TestNG helps us to generate test reports as well.
    TestNG can act as our Java compiler, we donâ€™t have
    to include the main method since
    TestNG can run our test codes.
    With annotations in TestNG, we can group our test cases using the xml file.
    TestNG has a built in html report.
    TestNG can pass parameters from the xml file.

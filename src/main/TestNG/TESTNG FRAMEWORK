    inspired from JUnit but introducing
    new functionalities that make
    it more powerful and easier to use.
    TestNG helps you to generate test reports as well.

    you can group your test cases using the xml file.
    ❖ TestNG has a builtin html report.
    ❖ TestNG can pass parameters from the xml file.

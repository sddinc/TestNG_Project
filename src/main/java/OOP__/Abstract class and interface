     Both help us to achieve
     abstraction in Java and
     both cannot be create object
     We can add abstract
     methods in both of them


    Class can extend ONE
    abstract class
    Class can implement
    MULTIPLE interfaces

     -Abstract classes can
     have abstract and
     non-abstract, static methods
     -Interfaces can
     have abstract, default, static methods



    Abstract classes can
    have instance, static and final variables.
    Interfaces can only
    have public static final variables.

    Abstract classes
    can have constructors
    Interfaces cannot
    have constructors

    Abstract classes can
    use all access modifiers
    with variables and methods
    Interfaces can only
    use public access modifier.

    ○ By providing only the setter or getter method,
     we can make the class read-only or write- only.
     In other words, we can skip the getter or setter methods.
    ○ It is a way to achieve data hiding in
        Java because other class will not be able
        to access the data through the private data members.
    ○ The encapsulate class is easy to test.
      So, it is better for unit testing.
    ○ The standard IDE's are providing the
      facility to generate the getters and setters.
      So, it is easy and fast to create an encapsulated class in Java.

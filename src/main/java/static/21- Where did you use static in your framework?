    ● I create utilities
    classes in my project
    for better code
    reusability and reduce
    redundant codes.
    In the utilities classes,
    I use static methods
    so that I can reach/call
    by the class name
    and use anywhere in my project.

    ○ In my project:
    ■ public static WebDriver getDriver (String browser) method
    ■ public static void closeDriver () method
    ■ Browser Utils: waitPlease(); verifyIsDisplayed() are static
    ■ ConfigurationReader: public static getProperty(String key)

    ● I also have a DatabaseUtil class
    where I create static methods
    to connect and run queries and get data.

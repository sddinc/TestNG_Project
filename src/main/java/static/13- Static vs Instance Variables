  ● Static Variable:
    ○ It belongs
    to the class
    which means
    there is only one copy.
    ○ Static variable gets
    memory only once in
    the class at the
    time of class loading
    ○ Static can be
    variables, method,
    block, inner class.
    ○ Static methods
    cannot call
    non-static members.
  ● Static block will
   be executed first.
   Whenever you call the class,
   the static block
   will be called/executed before everything.
   It will be
   executed only once
   when the class is loaded.

  ● Singleton Driver: I have one Driver
  declared static because
  I don’t want anyone
  to make a copy of
  it but use the same variable.

 Instance Variable:
  It is the property of
  the object which
  means every
  object will have its own copy

 Instance block:It will be
 called every
 time the object
 is created, even
 before the constructor.

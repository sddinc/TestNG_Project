  ● The methods or variables
 shared the same value
 of objects of the class.

  The static members belong
  to the class itself,
  not to any single object.
  we do not need to create
  an object to access
  those static variables or methods.
  It can be done directly
  through the class name.

  ○ For example:
   the name of the
   college is
   the common attribute
   to all the students.
   Therefore, the college
   name will be defined as static.

Both Error and Exception
are comes from Throwable in Java.


    Types of exceptions

    ● Checked Exceptions (Compile time):
    ○ without Runtime
    Exceptions are known
    as Checked exceptions
    as the compiler checks
    them during compilation
    to see whether the
     programmer has handled them or not.

    ○ If these exceptions are
    not handled/declared in the program,
    you will get compilation error,
    so this exception must
    be handled immediately.
     For example, SQLException,
     IOException, ClassNotFoundException etc.

    ● Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime):
    ○ Runtime Exceptions
    are also known as Unchecked Exceptions.
    These exceptions are
    not checked at compile time,
    so the compiler does
    not check whether the programmer has handled them or not.

    ○ Since Unchecked exception
    happen during runtime, so if they occur,
    the program will be interrupted
    during execution making
    these exceptions are more difficult to handle.
    ○ It’s the responsibility
    of the programmer to handle
    these exceptions and provide a
    safe exit. For example,
    ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException etc.

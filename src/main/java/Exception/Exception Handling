    System.out.println(new int[] {1,2,3}[100]); // out of bound exception occurs here
             } catch (Exception e){
    System.out.println("Out of Bound Exception caught here");
    }finally {
    System.out.println("Finally will be executed here regardless of any exception occurs or not"); }

    ● Throws keyword: to pass it to the caller’s responsibility to handle it.“throws” keyword

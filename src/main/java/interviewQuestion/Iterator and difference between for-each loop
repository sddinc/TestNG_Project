    ● Iterator works with ArrayList, not with Array.
      It helps us to iterate through the elements.
     With an iterator you can make changes (remove item)
      to the list while iterating.

    ● With for-each loops, we can only iterate through lists but cannot make any changes to our
    lists.

    Remove all data elements that are equal to 1
    List<Integer> list2 = new ArrayList<>();

    list2.addAll(Arrays.asList(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,5,6,7,8,1,1,1));
    Iterator<Integer> it = list2.iterator();
        while (it.hasNext()){
           int num = it.next();
           if(num==1){
            it.remove();
        }
    }
    System.out.println(list2);

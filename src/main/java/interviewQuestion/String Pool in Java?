    String poolis a special place to
    store all Strings in the
    Java Heap Memory.

    It is used to save memory.
    When we create a new String
    with double quote “”,
    Java looks into the
    String Pool first to check
    if that Sting (text) already
     exists in the pool or not.
    If it does, Java creates another
    reference for the same existing
    String in the pool but
    if it does not exist,
    it creates a new String
    in the pool.
    This helps to save memory
     by avoiding duplication.

    In Java, there are
    four access specifiers
   ● Public:
   accessible from everywhere
   The classes, methods,
   or variables which
   are defined as public,


    ● Protected: accessible
    within the
    same package or
    sub classes in different packages.
    It is a package private
    as long as it is not inherited.

    ● No modifier/default:
    accessible only within
    the same package.

    ● Private:
     accessible only within
     the class.
    In myproject:

    ● I use private access
    modifiers to achieve
    encapsulation to limit
    the outside access.
    I make the constructor
    private to avoid class
    instantiation as
    in the Driver class.
    All fields in POJO
    classes are private.

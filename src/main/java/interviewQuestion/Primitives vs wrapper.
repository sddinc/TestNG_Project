● Primitive: (primitiveis)
     It is simply just a container
     to keep/store data.
     Boolean, byte, char, int, float, double, long, short.
● Wrapper Class: (wrapperis)
   Every primitive
   has a wrapper class

    When we create an
    object to a wrapper class,
    we can store
    primitive data types.
    In other words,
    we can wrap a primitive
    value into a wrapper class object.

   All wrapper class
   are immutable in java.
   Wrapper class
   is ONLY loyal to its primitive
   Default value of wrapper class is ONLY null

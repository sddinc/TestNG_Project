    -The String class is immutable.
    The String Buffer class is mutable.

    The String is slow and
    consumes more memory when
    we concat too many strings
    because every time
    it creates a new instance.

    The String Buffer is
    fast and consumes
    less memory when we
    cancat strings.

    The String class
    overrides the equals()
    method of Object class.
    So we can compare the
    contents of two strings
    by equals() method.
    The String Buffer class
    doesn't override the
    equals() method of Object class.

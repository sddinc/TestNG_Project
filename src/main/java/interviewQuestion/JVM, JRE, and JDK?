    ● JDK: Java Development Kit.
    It helps you
    write a java program
    and save it as source code (.java).


    ● JRE: Java Runtime Environment:
    It has the minimum requirements
    to execute a Java application.
    It contains JVM and some libraries.

    ● JVM: Java Virtual Machine:
    It runs byte code (.class).
    JVM is included in both JDK and JRE.
    Whenever you run a Java program,
    JVM executes the program
    line by line so that is
    why it is called interpreter.

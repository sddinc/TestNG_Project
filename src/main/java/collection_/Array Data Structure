 An array is a data structure
 that holds a fixed
 number of values of a single type
 (both primitive and non-primitive(object)).

  The length of an
  array is established
  when the array is created.
  After creation,
  its length is fixed.

 ● Advantage of Java Array:
  It makes the code optimized,
  we can retrieve
  or sort the data easily.

  We can get any data located
  at any index position.random

 ● Disadvantage of Java Array: (disarrayis)
 ○ Size Limit: It is not dynamic so it is not resizable.

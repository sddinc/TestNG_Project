    /*
    1. LIST (lisis) - Interface: (list of things) -
    A List is an ordered Collection (sometimes called a sequence).
     Lists may contain duplicate elements. Elements can be inserted or accessed by their position in the list,
      using a zero-based index. They are dynamic sized - resizable. The List interface can allow n number of null values.
● ArrayList - class:
    ○ It has a fast iteration and is ordered by index. Preferably to use when searching for an element/object.
    ○ It is not sorted but can be sorted using Collections.sort() method.
● LinkedList - class:
    ○ LinkedList is a linear data structure.

    ○ It has slower iteration but faster addition and deletion. Preferably to use when adding and deleting an object/element.
● Vector -class:
    ○ Vector implements List Interface.
    ○ Like ArrayList it is synchronized (thread-safe) and due to which it gives poor performance in searching,
    adding, deleting and updating of its elements.
    ○ Vector has a child class: Stack
■ Stack: synchronized (thread-safe)
■ pop(): LIFO ==> Last in First Out - removes the last object from the stack

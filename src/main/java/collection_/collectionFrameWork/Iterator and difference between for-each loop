    ● Iterator works with
    ArrayList, not with Array.
    It helps us to iterate through the elements.

    ● With an iterator you can make
    changes (remove item) to
    the list while iterating.

    ● With for-each loops, we can
    only iterate through lists
    but cannot make any changes to our
    lists.

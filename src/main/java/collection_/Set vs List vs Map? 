    ● Set, List and Map are
    3 important interfaces
     of Java collection framework.
    ○ List provides ordered
    and indexed
    collection which
    may contain duplication.

    ○ Set provides an
    unordered collection
    of unique objects.
    There is NO duplication.
    Both List and Set
    implement the collection interface.

    ○ Map provides a
    data structure based on Key - Value.
     Key is always unique,
     Value can contain duplicate values.

    Both Hashtable and HashMap
     implement Map interface
     and both are Key and Value.

    Hashtable is synchronized,
    whereas HashMap is not.
    This makes HashMap better
    for non-threaded applications,
    as unsynchronized Objects
    typically perform better than synchronized ones.

    ● Hashtable does not
    allow null keys or values.
    HashMap allows one
    null key and any
    number of null values.

    ● For example; one of
    HashMap's subclasses
    is LinkedHashMap, so in
    the event that you'd want
    predictable iteration order (which is insertion order by default),
    you could easily swap out the HashMap for a LinkedHashMap.
    This wouldn't be as easy if you were using Hashtable.

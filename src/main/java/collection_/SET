 2. SET - Interface:A Set is a
    Collection that
    cannot contain
    duplicate elements.
    Set interface
    only allows a single null value.

 ● HashSet - class:
    ○ It doesn’t maintain
    any order, the elements would
     be returned in
     any random order.
    ○ It doesn’t allow
    duplicates.
     If we try to add a duplicate
      element in HashSet,
     the old value would
     be overwritten.
    ○ It allows null
     values however if we
     insert more than one null,
     it would still return only one null value.

 ● LinkedHashSet - class:
    ○ It maintains
    the insertion order.
    ○ It is basically
    an ordered version of HashSet
    so you can use it
    when you care
    about the insertion order.

 ● TreeSet - class:
    ○ TreeSet is similar
    to HashSet except that it
    sorts the elements
    in the ascending order
    ○ It is  slower
    than HashSet.`

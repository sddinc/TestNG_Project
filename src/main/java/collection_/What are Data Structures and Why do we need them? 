● Data structures are a way of organizing data for efficient manipulation:
insertion, searching, reading, and deletion of data.
 ● When there is more than one variable, it is data structure:
  Array, ArrayList, Maps, Set, HashMaps, LinkedLists,etc.
 ● Array: It is the simplest data structure.
 It is not resizable so it is static.
 ● In my project, I always use Java data structures
  for reading data and storing data from my application, database, or API.

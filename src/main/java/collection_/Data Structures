  way of organizing data
  and  manipulation: like
  insertion, searching,
  reading, and deletion of data.


  When there is more
  than one variable,
  it is data structure:
  Array, ArrayList,
  Maps, Set, HashMaps, LinkedLists, etc.

  Array: It is the simplest
  data structure.
  It is not resizable
  so it is static.

  ‚óè In my project,
   I always use Java data
   structures for reading
    data and storing
    data from our
     application, database, or API.

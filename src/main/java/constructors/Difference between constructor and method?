    Constructor
    It is a special method
    which creates an object.

    It needs to match
    with the class name

    The constructor
    is invoked implicitly
    whenever we
    create an object

    The Java compiler
    provides a default
    constructor if
    we don't have any
    constructor in a class.


    Constructor are not
    inherited by child class
    if there is an inheritance

    Method
    A method is used
    to expose the behavior
    of an object.
    A method must
    have a return type.

    The method is
    invoked explicitly.

    The method is not
    provided by the
    compiler in any case.

    The method name
    may or may not
    be same as class name.
    Methods are inherited
    by child class
    if there is a inheritance

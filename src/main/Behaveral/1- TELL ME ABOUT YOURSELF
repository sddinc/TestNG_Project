    First of all I would like
    to thank you for having me.

    I've been in the software
    business for 7 years.

    I am holding an SDET position
    in my current team.

    My main responsibilities
    are to design, develop
    and maintain Test Automation
    Framework that verifies user
    stories and system requirements,
    for that purpose
    I implement functional,
    smoke and regression tests.

    In my current company
    I have specialized in Java,
    Selenium WebDriver, Maven,
    Cucumber, Junit,
    Jenkins, API, Postman....

    • I am also experienced in
    TestNG and Data Driven Testing.

    • I use POSTMAN and
    REST ASSURED LIBRARY
    for API  testing

    I have extensive
    knowledge on SQL queries

    I developed my current
    framework based on
    Page Object Model
    in order to increase efficiency.

    for  managing
    and centralize
    I am using Maven
    project building tool
    for for  managing
    and centralize  the
    dependencies in my project .

    I achieve continuous integration
    and schedule my test
    executions by using Jenkins.

    I use Git to manage
    version control.

    I use Jira Xray as
    test management
    and bug tracking tool.

   	Also, as a part of the
   	Agile Scrum Team,
    I participate in
    the several walk through
    meetings for the
    requirement reviews.

     As a conclusion;
     I have quite hands on experience
     on UI, API and DataBase testing.
     That’s pretty much about myself.
     If you have any particular
     question I can elaborate on that topic.

    The best thing I like about a Manager
    is that the Manager should be able to
     coordinate with the other teams so that
     we can get the updated documents,
      for example, updated requirements
      documents right away. A Manager who can
      efficiently distributes the work to the team,
      without being biased and easily accessible and
       protective to his team for the right cause.
         As far as “what I don’t like” is concerned,
         I don’t like a manager who keeps coming
         to desk 10 times a day to check my work even
         if it is just a regular work. On
         ce the responsibility is given, the team member should be trusted and let his work done.

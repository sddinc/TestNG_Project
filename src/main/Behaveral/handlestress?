    - One of our sprints my developer deployed code very late time and
    I didnâ€™t have much time to get job done. But I was working so hard
    worked extra hours and especially nights and I was finished my task on time.
    - My first approach is trying to calm down and work extra hours.
     I also eat chocolate.
    - Also, in scrum environment we working as a team.
    I always maintain good communication and relationship with my colleagues.
    So, they trust me, and they can communicate with me very easily.
    I always avoid miscommunication and my team believe me every time.

    - Sometimes some requirements are not understandable,
    so I try to figure out and I try to understand the requirements.
    In the beginning of the application I spend extra effort to understand functionality.

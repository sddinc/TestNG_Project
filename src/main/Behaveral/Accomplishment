    One of my accomplishments
    I would say is establishing
    a great trustworthy
    relationship within the team.
    If you are asking for technical :
    When I joined my last project,
    PRIVATE WEBELEMENT


    When I started to work in my last company
     we were in 5th Sprint of the project.
     I started the work and understand
     the application and framework.
     After 2 sprints, I figured out that almost
     nobody was using scenario outline in my QA team.
     They had to repeat almost each similar step because
     of that issue. It was increasing redundancy
     and work load over my team. Actually I like
     implementing DDT in my frameworks as much as possible.
     Fortunately we were just at the
     beginning of the project and that was a
     chance to fix this redundancy as soon as possible.
    I decided to talk with my QA lead to solve this
    issue. After telling to my QA lead, he liked
    it and told me to prepare a short presentation
    to tell other team members during retrospective meeting.
    Almost everybody embraced the idea and we started
    to use Scenario Outline for each test case
    if we have to insert similar data in the the same test case.

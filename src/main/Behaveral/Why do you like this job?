    I like this job, because it is process oriented.
    Meaning that I get an opportunity to work
    from analyzing the requirement documents
    to writing test plans, test cases, testing the application,
    logging defects, retesting, preparing reports
     and finally testing in production as well.
     Therefore, I am involved from the very beginning
     to the end of the software development life cycle (SDLC) process.
      I like this.
    Another reason is I like to find defects.
    I enjoy logging defects. The more defects I find, the happier I am.

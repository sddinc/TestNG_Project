    we had a new developer.
    He is young and but very smart kid.
    Every time I found a bug, it
    made the developer nervous
    and he disagreed
    to accept it and most of
    the time I had to calm
    him down and sometimes
    we had to ask BA for clarification
    Then I realize the requirement
    itself was not specific enough,
    so I understood it differently
    than the developer
    In the Sprint Retro, I said we should
    spend more time on requirement
    clarification because
    you know that is the key
    to the project success.
    We did so and this issue was solved.

    - In first week, you know, I will get done all the paper works,
     getting the machines and necessary access to the project, databases etc.
    - Then I will have to learn the company culture. Boarding process.
    - I have to learn also more about my projects and my teammates.
    - I think, understanding what the project is doing, it is very important if I want to be more productive.

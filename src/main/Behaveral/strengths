    I am also honest
    person and I have the
    skills and expertise
    in QA process.One of my
    greatest strengths is
    that I have a graphing
    skill I mean
    For example; when I saw
    or heard a paragraph,
    event, case or even
    if a sentence, I can
    easily graph it in
    my mind and implement
    it in a real life.

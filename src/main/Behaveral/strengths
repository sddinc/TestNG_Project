    As you know, many people hesitate
    to ask question however
    I like asking questions
    to understand everything well.
     Because there migth be a lot of
     misunderstanding in agile environment.

    I am also honest
    person and I have the
    skills and expertise
    in QA process.

    . I always create checklist for almost everything.
     How to create my test cases,
     how to integrate selenium grid,
     how to configure jenkins.
     Because we don't implement everything
     everyday and we may forget some
     points which can have a side
     effects on something else.
     By using those small checklists
     I can make sure that I go over each
     and every single step without missing anything.

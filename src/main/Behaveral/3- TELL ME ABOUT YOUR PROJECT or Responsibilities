     My current project is
     The ICE Mortgage Technology
     Platform application.

     Ice Mortgage Technology
     solutions help to  lenders
     to get more loans,
     reduce  costs,
     and reduce the time
     to close.


     We help lenders succeed
     through innovation
     and connection,

     Also  we help borrowers achieve
     their dream of home ownership.


    And My responsibilities are,
    first to do manual test
    and then according to manual
    test results to write
    my automation scripts.

    I am responsible for
    executing Regression
    test at the end of sprint.

    I am responsible for
    checking the reports
    of Smoke test to make
    sure that application
    is up and running and
    the environment is stable.

    for reaching out these goals
    I  Design, Develop and
    Maintain Test
    Automation Framework that
    verifies user stories
    and system requirements.

    For that purpose
    I implement
    functional, smoke
    and regression tests.

    As a part of the Agile
    Scrum Team, I participate
    in the several ceremonies
    such as grooming, planning,
    daily scrum, demo,
    retrospective and code
    review meeting for the
    requirement review,
    user story analyzing and
    provide  feedbacks
    to the team.

    After user story allocation,
    I start to analyze user
    stories and write
    my test cases on Jira.


    After finishing the
    test case writing,
    I start with manual
    testing and then
    implement test automation
    if it is possible.

    If I come across any defect
    I log the defect on Jira.
    Once the bug reported
    is fixed by developer,

    I retest it and if it
    is passed, I will close it.
    If the defect is not fixed,
    I reopen the ticket again.

    I am responsible for checking
    the result of Smoke test
    every morning to make
    sure that application
    is up and running properly
    and environment is stable.
         If there is any issue,
         I will analyze it;
         If it is a service issues,
         I will immediately
         contact DevOps team.

         If it is about my scripts,
         I will debug my scripts.

         If it is a bug,
         I will log the defect.

    I am also responsible
    for executing Regression test
    before end of each sprint.

     We have code freeze day
     on second Wednesday and Thursday
     of the sprint in order
     to make the environments
     more stable for regression
     test execution.

     Lastly, as a cross functional
     team member I am always willing
     to help all my team members
     in any way to achieve our sprint goals.

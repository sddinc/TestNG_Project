    Requirements Analysis
    Test Plan Creation
    Test Case Creation
    Environment Setup
    Test Execution
    Test Cycle Closure


  Step 1: Requirement Analysis:
    Analyze and study the requirements.
    This phase helps
    to identify the scope of the testing.

    PO or team lead assigns
    you user stories to test ,

    I read the user story
    carefully and make
    sure to understand it well.

  Step 2: Test Plan Creation:

    A detail of how the test will proceed,
     who will do the testing,
      what will be tested,
     in how much time the
     test will take place,
     and to what quality level the test will be performed.

     TEMPLATE:
     Test Plan Identifier
     Introduction
     References
     Test Items
     Features to be Tested
     Features Not to be Tested
     Approach
     Item Pass/Fail Criteria
     Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements

  Step 3: Test Case Creation
     Test Deliverables
     Test Environment
     Estimate Schedule
     Staffing and Training Needs
     Responsibilities
     Risks
     Assumptions and dependencies
      Approvals

 Step 4: Environment Setup

  Developers should push their codes from dev environment to QA environment
  Activities
  Understand the required architecture, environment set-up and prepare hardware and software requirement list for the Test Environment.
  Setup test Environment and test data
  Perform smoke test on the build
  Deliverables
  Environment ready with test data set up
  Smoke Test Results.000000

  Step 5: Test Execution
  During this phase test team will carry out the testing based on the test plans and the test cases prepared test manually or/and automatically
  Activities
  Execute tests as per plan
  Document test results, and log defects for failed cases Map defects to test cases in RTM
  Retest the Defect fixes
  Track the defects to closure
  Deliverables
  Completed RTM with the execution status Test cases updated with results
  Defect reports
  Step 6: Test Cycle Closure
  Test Report on Jira
  Defect Report
  All of the bugs are handled Test Lead is responsible

    Grid is a set up that consists of Hub and nodes
    Hub is a central machine that all nodes connect to
    Has IP address and port number. Then we link the Hub to Nodes
    There is a main machine which is called a Hub and multiple nodes (the machines that actually run our tests)
    The order of execution is;
    Our code > remote driver > Selenium Hub > Selenium nodes (might be multiple ones)
    I asked my Selenium Hub to run my tests
    Then selenium hub will find a node that is linked to the hub and run my test from there.
    We can have as many nodes as we want but only one hub.

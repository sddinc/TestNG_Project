    Hub in Selenium Grid?
    A hub is server or a central point that
    controls the test executions on different machines.

    Node in Selenium Grid?
    Node is the machine, which is attached to the hub.
     There can be multiple nodes in Selenium Grid.

     When do you use Selenium Grid?
     Selenium Grid can be used to execute same or different
     test scripts on multiple platforms and browsers concurrently
      so as to achieve distributed test execution


      How does Selenium Grid work?

      Grid is a set up that consists of Hub and nodes
      Hub is a central machine that all nodes connect to
      Has IP address and port number. Then we link the Hub to Nodes
      There is a main machine which is called a Hub
      and multiple nodes (the machines that actually run our tests)
      The order of execution is;
      Our code > remote driver > Selenium Hub > Selenium nodes (might be multiple ones)
      I asked my Selenium Hub to run my tests
      Then selenium hub will find a node that is linked to the hub and run my test from there.
      We can have as many nodes as we want but only one hub.


      How do you set up your selenium grid?

      Our hub and nodes will be set up in Amazon AWS Ec2 machines (ideally)
      We can ask our hub to run tests and then the hub will find a node and
      run our test from there. Each node registers to the HUB with a certain configuration
      and HUB is aware of the browser available on the node.
      When a request comes to the HUB for a specific browser (with DesiredCapabilities object),
      the HUB, if found a match for the requested browser,
       redirects the call to *that* particular GRID Node and then
       a session is established bidirectionally and execution starts.

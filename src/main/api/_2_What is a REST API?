    ➔ It is a set of rules that developers follow when they create their API.
    One of these rules states that you should be able to get a piece
    of data (called a resource) when you link to a specific URL.
    ➔ Each URL is called a request when the data sentback to you is called response.
    ➔ RESTAPI acts like a business logic layer between the server and front-endlayer.Itis
    independent of any language as it gets everything in xml/Json format.

    I verify that each REST API endpoint is working as expected and
     data structure and schema is a proper JSON
     (it is also named contract testing).
    I send POST, PUT, GET, DELETE type of requests
    and verify response status code and response body.
    I also do positive and negative testing of API.

    How I do positive testing,
    	 I send valid path and query parameters,
    	 valid headers,
    	 valid request body to valid url and verify that
    	 response status code is correct and
    	 response body is as expected

    How I do negative testing,
    	 I send invalid request parameters
    	 or invalid headers
    	 or invalid request json body and verify
    	 that response status code is not 200
    	 and response body contains error message
    	 (for example there are 100 employees numbered from
    	  1 to 100 I send 101 as a parameter and I should be able see 404 Not Found The requested resource was not found.)

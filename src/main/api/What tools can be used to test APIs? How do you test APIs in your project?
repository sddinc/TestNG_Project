    In my project we have REST APIs. For manual testing we use Postman.
    We set global and environment variables so we can easily
    change any values from one location so that
    the respective change can immediately be updated wherever the variable is called.
    We also use Postmans available JavaScript methods to validate status codes and verify data from our response body,
    and Postmanâ€™s collection runner to execute multiple calls at once in the desired order.
    Additionally we are using RestAssured Java library.
    As a tester I send an API request (whether it is a GET, POST, PUT or DELETE call) and then I verify the status code, response body and check headers.
    I verify that each endpoint is working as expected. I do positive and negative testing of APIs:

    Positive - I am sending valid requests, headers, parameters, and Json body and then verify that response is 200/201
    Negative- I am sending invalid requests, headers, parameters, and body, expecting the status code not to be 200/201.

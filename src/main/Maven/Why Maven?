    ❖ Central Repository
    to get dependencies:
    You don’t have to
    download jars to
    your computer as maven will take care of it for you.

    ❖ Maintaining common
    structure across the organization:
    If we use maven, everyone in the team will follow the
    same template given by maven.

    ❖ Flexibility in Integrating with CI tools:
    Maven can easily integrate with CI tools like Jenkins.

    ❖ PlugIns for Test Framework Execution:
    Mave has plugins supporting
    tools like TestNG and JUnit
    which help you to
    use all features of TestNG in maven as well.

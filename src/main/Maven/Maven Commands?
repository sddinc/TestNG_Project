    ❖ mvn clean:
    Clears the target directory
    into which Maven normally builds your project.
    It is recommended to run clean previously built executions.
    C:\users\adurhan\Mavenjava>mvn clean

    ❖ mvn compile:
    Assume that you have hundreds of test cases,
    it will be really difficult to find syntax errors out of hundreds of lines of codes.
     The Compile command will NOT run the test but check the syntax errors.
     Compiles the source code of the project.
    C:\users\adurhan\Mavenjava>mvn compile

    ❖ mvn test:
    Runs the tests against the compiled
    source code using a suitable unit testing framework.
    These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed.
    When you run “test”, it will check for the local
    JARS and if they are in the folder,
     it will run the test BUT if it cannot find the JARS,
     it will download the JARS from the repository of Maven.
    C:\users\adurhan\Mavenjava>mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @Smoke"

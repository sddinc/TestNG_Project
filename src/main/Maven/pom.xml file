   A Project Object Model or POM is
  the fundamental unit of Maven.
  It is an XML file that contains
  information about the project and
  configuration details used by Maven
  to build the project. When executing
  a task or goal, Maven looks for the
  pom.xml file in the project.
  It reads the pom.xml, gets the needed
  configuration information,
  then executes the goal.
  Some of the configuration that can be specified
  in the pom.xml are the project dependencies,
  the plugins or goals that can be executed,
  the build profiles, and so on. Other
  information such as the project version,
  description and so on can also be specified.

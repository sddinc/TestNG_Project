     I run my tests in Maven using the mvn test command.
     I need my project to be run from Maven because
     Jenkins runs the tests using Maven.
    ❖ Sometimes when I run locally
     I use mvn verify because
    I use a plugin in my pom
    file that generates reports to verify lifecycle.

    ❖ When I run in Jenkins,
    I use the command mvn test.
    I don’t need to say verify here
     because Jenkins creates reports using its own plugin,
    it does not use the plugin in the pom file.

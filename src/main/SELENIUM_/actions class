    We can control
    the mouse and the
    keyboard
    with action class.

    Actions class provides methods  like:
    -- Hover over
    -- DoubleClick
    -- Scroll
    -- DragAndDrop
    -- Right click... mix/match operators

    Actions action = new Actions(driver)
    action.click()
    .hold()
    .perform()
    .moveToElement(element)
    .keydown()build()
    .dragAndDrop(source, target).perform() .sendKeys() different from the one we usually use

    We can perform following operation using action class:
    ● click (): Simply click on element
    ● doubleClick (): Double clicks on Element
    ● contextClick() : Perform a context-click (right click) on an element
    ● clickAndHold(): Clicks at the present mouse location (without releasing)
    dragAndDrop(source, target):




  How to Drag and Drop?
  We need to use Actions class
  Actions action = new Actions(driver);
     action.clickAndHold(driver.findElement(By.id("item"))) .moveToElement(driver.findElement(By.id("destination")))
   .release().build().perform();


   What is the syntax for double click action ?
   we need to locate the element first:
   WebElement el = driver.findELement

   Actions actions = new Actions (driver);

   actions.moveTo(el).doubleClick().build.perform();

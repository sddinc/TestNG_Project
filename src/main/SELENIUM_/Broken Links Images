    Broken links are links or URLs that are not reachable.
    They may be down or not functioning due to some server error.
    To find broken links using selenium it means
    we need to check the link which is pointing to the wrong URL or invalid URL.
    An URL will always have a status with 2xx which is valid.
    There are different HTTP status codes which are having different purposes.
    For an invalid request, HTTP status is 4xx and 5xx.

    Some of the HTTP status codes:
    200 – Valid Link
    404 – Link not found
    400 – Bad request
    401 – Unauthorized
    500 – Internal Error

    Step to find broken links:
    ● Collect all the links from the webpage.
    All the links are associated with the Tag ‘a‘.
    ● Create a list of type WebElement to store all the Link elements in it.
    ● Now Create a Connection using URL object( i.e ., link)
    ● Connect using the Connect Method.
    ● Use getResponseCode () to get response code. eg 200
    List<WebElement> links = driver.findElements(By.tagName("a"));
        for (int i=0; i<links.size(); i++) {
        String linkURL = links.get(i).getAttribute("href");
           if (linkURL!= null) {
           URL obj = new URL(linkURL);
           HttpURLConnection conn = ((HttpURLConnection) obj.openConnection());
           int rCode = conn.getResponseCode();
           if (rCode == 200) {
           System.out.println(i+ " Link is valid------" + linkURL); }
           else {
           System.out.println(i+ " Link is broken------" + linkURL); }
           }else {
           System.out.println(links.get(i).getText());
           System.out.println(i+ " Link is broken ********" + linkURL); }
           }
           }

JavaScript Alerts
 We can handle web based pop-ups using Alert Interface.

 Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();

 alert.dismiss();

  alert.accept()

  alert.accept()

  alert.sendkeys(“text”)

   Html Alerts -

   They are like regular
   web elements so we can locate and click on them.


   ● Windows/OS Alerts:
   Selenium cannot handle
   OS (operation system)/windows based alerts.
    There are 3rd party tools such as AutoIT, Robot, etc.

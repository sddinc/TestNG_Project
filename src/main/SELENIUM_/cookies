    ● Each cookie is associated with a name, value, domain, path,
    expiry, and the status of whether it is secure or not.
    In order to validate a client, a server parses all of these values in a cookie.
    ● When Testing a web application using a selenium web driver,
    we may need to create, update or delete a cookie.
    ● For example, when automating Online Shopping Application,
     we may need to automate test scenarios like place order,
     View Cart, Payment Information, order confirmation, etc.

    ● If cookies are not stored,
    we will need to perform login
    action every time before
    we execute above listed test scenarios.
    This will increase our
    coding effort and execution time.
    ● The solution is to store cookies in a File.
    Later, retrieve the values of cookie from this file and add to it our current browser.
    ●session. As a result, we can skip the login steps
    in every Test Case because your driver session has this information in it.
● The application server now treats your browser
session as authenticated and directly takes you to your requested URL.


Handle Cookies?

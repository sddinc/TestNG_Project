    ● NoSuchElementException
    I usually face this exception which
    usually happens because
    of synchronization issues,
    incorrect locators,
    or hidden elements in iFrame.

    ● StaleElementException
    It usually happens
    when the element has
    been deleted entirely
    or no longer attached
    to the DOM. This is how I handle it:
    - Element is not attached to
    DOM: ‘try catch block’ within ‘for loop’ or
    - 1.Refresh the page and
    try again for the same element.
    2.Wait for the element till it gets available.
    ● TimeOutException

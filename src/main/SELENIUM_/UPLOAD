    ● First, locate the element
     which takes the path of
     the file we want to upload.
     It is usually “Choose File” button
    WebElement input = driver.findElement(“id”);
    ● Second, provide the
     path to the file using
     the sendKeys method:
    input.sendKeys(“/path/to/file/here”);


    ● We need to locate
    the upload button in html.
    ● The element will have tag input.
    ● Then we do sendKeys
    by passing the path to the file which we want to upload.

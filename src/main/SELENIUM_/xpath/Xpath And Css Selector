     backward or forward while
     css works only in forward direction.
    ● Xpath can work with text,
     css cannot work.

    css cannot search by index, but css
    is working faster than xpath.
    ● CSS is faster than XPath
    but I never experienced it in my framework as it is a smaller
    project.

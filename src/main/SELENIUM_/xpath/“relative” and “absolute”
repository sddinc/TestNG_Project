    Absolute XPath:
    ● using (/) single slash showing
    the root element and goes
    all the way to the element we’re locating.
    ● If there are any changes
    in the path of the
    element then the XPath will fail.
    ● Not suggested to use
    as the developers
    may change the path.

    Relative Path:
    ● The path starts from
    the middle of the HTML
    DOM structure with double slash (//).
    ● Starts with // which means
     it searches the element anywhere at the webpage.
    ● No need to write a long XPath. More preferred!

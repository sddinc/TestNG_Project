  no locator is available
  to find an element
  so you may need to use text().

  there is no id, class, etc.
  available so you can just search
  for the text “announcement”
  which is written on the button.
   In this case, Selenium will look for the text to locate it.

   It is not that much recommended
    to use text() since the developers change it a lot.

  ● Syntax:
   ○ Matching exact text:   //tag[.=‘text’] →
                            //span[.= ‘announcement’]
   ○ Matching partial text: //tag[contains(text(), ‘text’)] →
                             //span[contains(text() ,‘announcement’)]

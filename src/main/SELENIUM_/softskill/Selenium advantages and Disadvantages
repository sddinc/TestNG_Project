    ● Selenium is
    open source and free
    to use without
    any licensing cost

    ● It supports
     multiple languages
     like Java, Ruby, Python, C#...

    ● It supports
    multi-browser testing

    ● It has a good
    amount of resources
    and a supporting community.

    ● It supports
     many operating
    systems like
    Windows, Mac, Linux ...

    ● It interacts with
    the web applications


    disadvantages
    ● Selenium supports
    only web-based applications,
    does not support
    windows-based
    application

    ● No built-in reporting tool,
    it needs third party
    tools for report generation activity

    ● Cannot work with
    graphics,
    captchas, barcodes, shapes


    ● Hard to write
    good and stable locators
    since they are
     dependent on web developers.

    ● We have to use
    external libraries and tools for
    erforming tasks like testing framework (TestNG, JUnit),
     reading from external files (Apache POI for excel)

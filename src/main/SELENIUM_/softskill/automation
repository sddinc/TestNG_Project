  ● Using software or computers to automate
  manually done actions.

  ● Test automation is automating the testing
  process using specific softwares.
  This requires new sets of skills and using
  tools like Selenium,
  cucumber, Serenity, UFT, appium, Protractor, etc.


  How do you decide if tests can be automated?
    ● Functionality has to bring
     value to the business.

    ● Functionality needs
    to be working (no bugs).
     Whatever you want to automate needs to be
    working without any issue so you can automate it.

    ● Functionality must be stable.

  What functionalities cannot be automated using Selenium?
    ● Captcha
    ● Broken functionalities:
    if the function is not working,
    you cannot automate it.

    ● QR or Bar Codes can
    only be automated by using 3rd party API.

    ● 3rd party dependencies:

    ● Test cases
     related to cosmetics,
     look, etc., because they are not about functionality.

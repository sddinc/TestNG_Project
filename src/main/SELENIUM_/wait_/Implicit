    Wait time is applied
    to all elements in the scripts.
    It is more global.

    ○ We don’t specify
     the expected condition
     on the element to be located.

    ○ It is recommended to use when the elements are located with the time frame
    specified in the implicit wait.

    ○ If the wait
     time set for 10 seconds
     but the element found in 3, the remaining 7
    seconds are not waited in both implicit and explicit wait

    driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(5,TimeUnit.SECONDS);

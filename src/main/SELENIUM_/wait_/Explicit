    ONLY specified  element
    ○ We need to specify
     the “ExpectedCondition”
     on the element to be located.
    ○ It is recommended
     to use when the elements
     are taking a long time to load and also

    verifying the property
    of the element like
    visibilityOfElement,
    elementToBeClickable,
     elementToBeSelected, etc.


    webDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait (driver, 5);

    ● if there is a select tag
     we need to create a new object
     from Selenium
    ● This new object will
    come with its own methods
    like selectByValue, selectByIndex, etc.
    Methods from Select Class:
    Select s = new Select(driver.findElement(By.id(“cat”)));

    Select by Value =  s.selectByValue("")
    Select by VisibileText =s.selectByVisibleText("")
    Select by Index =s.selectByIndex("")
    ● If there is a select tagName, it means that 99% it is a static dropdown.


    without SELECT tag

    Find locator
    and click on the
    option you want to select

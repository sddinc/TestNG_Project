  -There are multiple
  ways to achieve
  cross browser testing
  depending on the framework.

  testng,Cucumber and JUnit
  they have own way

  In my framework,
  I use JUnit/Cucumber.
  To handle different browsers,
  I use a properties
  file where I can pass the
  name of the browser that
  I want to work with.

   I also have a Driver utility
    class that can open different
    types of browsers depending on the
    value in the properties file.
    I have a switch statement in the Driver
     utility so if I define the value of browser
      as “chrome” in the properties file,
      Driver utility class will return a ChromeDriver.

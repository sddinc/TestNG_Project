  Frame is a html document
  inside another html document.



    Frames cannot be handled
    by Selenium directly.
    To identify frame we
    use id, name and frame webelement.

    First, locate the iframe
    Switch to another iframe
    with driver.switchTo().frame
    Frame is a html
    document inside another html document.

    Web driver handles one page/html document at a time.
    To control another frame, we always need to switch
    Driver.switchTo.frame(webelement) - find the iframe and pass as a param ID
    Driver.switchTo.frame(string) - find the id or name of the iframe and pass as a param
    Driver.switchTo.frame(int) - find the index and pass as a param

    How to handle multiple frames? (multipleframesis) Õù
    If there are 4 frames,
     we have to go through each from consecutively
     to reach certain frame.
     we can't jump to the 3rd frame from 1st frame


    I will first switch frame 1
    driver.switchTo().frame(1);and enter text then come to default main

    using driver.switchTo().defaultContent();

    again I will switch to second frame
    driver.switchTo().frame(2);
    and click on button

    ● I work with the DevOps team to
    create my smoke tests in Jenkins.
    ● To run my tests, I need certain
    plugins to be installed on Jenkins,
    I also need java, maven
    configured on jenkins, I also need browsers
    installed on the server where the tests will run.
    ● Since only DevOps team members have the right to do the configurations in Jenkin, I work
    with them for certain setup or configuration.
    ● Once the configuration of the Jenkins is completed, I can create and run the smoke test job

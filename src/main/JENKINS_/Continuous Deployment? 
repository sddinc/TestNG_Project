   Continuous deployment means that every change that you make,
   goes through the pipeline, and if it passes all the tests,
   it automatically gets deployed into production.
   When a developer checks in code, the automated processes take the code
   and move it through the entire lifecycle and if it passes each gate,
   it gets deployed directly to production.

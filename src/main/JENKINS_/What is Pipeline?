    Pipeline is a set of processes that take
    the code from version control and compile,
    build, test and deploy to production in automated fashion.

    The pipeline breaks down the software delivery process into stages.
    Each stage is made of different tasks which can be carried out in parallel.
    When all tasks in a stage passes, the next stage is triggered.

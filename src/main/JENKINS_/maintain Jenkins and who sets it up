    which is in charge of setting and maintaining Jenkins for deployments.
    ● DevOps work with developers to create
    jobs for building and deploying the application.
    ● For regression and smoke tests, they work with
    the automation testers who provide the information of the tests,
    configuration info, and also the emails for the notifications.
    ○ Git path

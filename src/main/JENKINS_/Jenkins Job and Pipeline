● Pipeline is a more advanced version of Jenkins job.
To declare Jenkins pipeline, you need to use DSL that is based on groovy.
With a pipeline, you have more freedom. You can parallelize your tasks.
 Pipeline looks like a script and usually saved as a jenkins file.
 Pipeline can be used to develop CI/CD pipeline or to develop smoke/regression jobs for testing.

● Pipeline is done by Devops or Senior Developers
so as testers we DON’T get involved with this process
and only work with Jenkins jobs.
Not all companies do Pipeline, so no need to mention in the interview.

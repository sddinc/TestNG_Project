    ● In my project, we use Jenkins for CI/CD and
    we have Jenkins jobs for regression and smoke tests.

    We usually don’t have access to Jenkin configuration which is done by Devops but here are the steps:
    1. Pull the code from repo (GitHub)
    2. Specify the maven goal - command - run “mvn test”
    3. Generate the cucumber HTML report
    4. Send email notifications / slack notifications
    5. Publish tests results on Jira with Xray (optional)


    ● Our Smoke test has 2 triggers,
    which helps to automate the process:
    ○ First trigger is based on time:
      The smoke test runs everyday at 5am.
    ○ Second trigger is based on a new build:
       Once the new build has been deployed,
    smoke test triggers automatically to make sure everything is up and running.
    ● In my company, we have Smoke Tests only.
    I know some other companies have "sanity
    tests" which are kinda a smaller
    scale of smoke tests but my company implements only smoke testing.

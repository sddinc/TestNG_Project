    ● JIRA treats all work inside
     it as an Issue
    ● So, in JIRA to create a defect would be to create an issue of the type “Bug”.

    ● Defect reporting :
        ○ Defect ID
        ○ Defect title
        ○ Defect description (steps to reproduce)
        Environment information
        Screenshot(attachment)
        Severity
        Assign it to Developer

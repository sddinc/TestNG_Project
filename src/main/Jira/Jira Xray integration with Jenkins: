    I was not responsible for any configuration,
    the DevOps team did take care of it.
    1. Download xray plugin for Jenkins. You will need to download this plugin from Xray website
    2. Install plugin
    3. Provide jira information in jenkins settings
    4. Add jira xray into the jenkins job as post build action

   ● Xray plugin knows your scenarios based
   on the tags you add at the top of them.
   For example, I have a “@CT25-19” tag for “Verify Dashboard Page” scenario,
   this tag is also used in the Jira so Xray can map it out.
   ● Each scenario is a test in Jira; each feature file is a test set in
   Jira since there are more than one tests in a feature file.

    1. Create a test on Jira.
    2. If needed, we can create a test set. Keep in mind that one jira test/ticket is used for only
    one scenario or scenario outline.
    3. Export test/test set as a cucumber feature file.
    4. Import that feature file into your project.

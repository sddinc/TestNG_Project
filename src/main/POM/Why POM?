      for UI Automation  We just
      need to find the elements
      and perform automations on it.
      But in time, there
      will be many webElements and
      more lines of code in the test suite.
      The script maintenance will be a very big problem.
      If there are 50 scripts
      for the same element,
      with any change in that element,
      we will need to change
      all 50 scripts. This will be time consuming and error prone.
      A better approach is to create a seperate class which would find the webElements,
      fill or verify them. The class can be reused in all the scripts using that element.

      If there is a change in the element,
      we would change in the class where we keep the element, not in all to 50 different scripts.
